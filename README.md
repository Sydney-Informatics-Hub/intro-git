---
# Read me

Version control is an essential part of modern software engineers, enabling
developers to track and revert changes to their code with confidence and
helping teams collaborate across complex codebases. This workshop is a hands-on
introduction to git, the most widely-used distributed version control system.

You'll learn how to initialise a git repository and record changes to a
codebase, how to use GitHub to collaborate with other researchers, how
to structure your workflow using branches and how to resolve the conflicts
which arise when different team members have worked on the same parts of your
codebase. The course will also describe some of the concepts behind git and
describe best practices for sharing and citing code.
